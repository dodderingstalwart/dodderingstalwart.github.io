This is the start of my [Homelab](https://github.com/dodderingstalwart/homelab).
### Setting up the hardware for the Homelab.
The hardware will be one control node and three worker nodes.
Lets start with the control node that will be using an old laptop running Fedora.
The control node is using an AMD Ryzen 3 with 4 CPUs with 16GB RAM.
On to the worker nodes which include and old desktop and 2 RPi 5.
The two RPi 5 have 8GB of ram while the old desktop has 16GB RAM.
The desktop is running Ubuntu Server with an old Intel i5 with 4 CPUs.
